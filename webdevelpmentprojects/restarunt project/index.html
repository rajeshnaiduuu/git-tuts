                        Food trends are ever-changing and the menu should always be adept to them. Ensuring youâ€™re at par with your competitors, while your market research is up to date will really make you stand out. Lebanese and Asian food have gained momentum of late and how. While including dishes from these cuisines, also remember to stock up on seasonal fruits to use in inventive and progressive dishes, to entice consumers. Moreover, 2023 has been proclaimed the international year of Millets, so millets should certainly be the hero ingredient in varied dishes.
